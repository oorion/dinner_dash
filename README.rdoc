Dinner Dash was a 10 day group project spent developing a restaurant ordering platform using testÂ­driven development and pair programming. My personal focus was on restful routing, session carts, and checkout functionality.

The production application includes allows a user to order coffee and coffee related products.  It also allows an admin to track and update orders as they are paid and completed.

To run in development, run the following commands:
  git clone git@github.com:oorion/dinner_dash.git
  cd dinner_dash
  bundle
  rake db:setup
  rails server

In your browser, visit localhost:3000

To view additional functionality, use the following user and admin accounts:
  standard user:  username: rachel password: password
  admin user:  username: josh password: password

To run the test suite run:
  rake test
